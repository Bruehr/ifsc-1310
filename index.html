  <h2>Progressive Enhancement Writing Assignment</h2>
  <p>Progressive enhancement is a website building strategy that focuses on building from the content first and then adding all the bells and whistles after you have built a good base.  The first layer you will build is the HTML layer which is the structures of the page.  A well structure HTML document will produce a page with all the content a user would need to see its bare bone nature.  This is important for older browsers whom might not support all the bells and whistles.  The next layer is to add the style to the page with CSS.  With this you can enhance your site with different color options, different fonts, and oven did layouts for various types of content.  The third layer for progressive enhancement is JavaScript.  JavaScript can be used to affect the behavior of your site; you can use it to create dynamic content such as an image carousals or interactive elements for the user.  HTML, CSS, and JavaScript build upon each other progressively to create the webpages you see today.</p>
  <h2>Dragon Project Revision and Reflection</h2>
  <p>	For the peer review of my SpaceX project, I had my mom look take a look at it, even though she has no technical experience whatsoever she is a retired teacher so I figured she would be a good person to look over the project.  One of the only things she commented on with my first draft was that she didn’t like the font because it was hard for her to read.  So, for the final draft I changed to an easier to read font tried to make sure there was more contrast between the background and the text.  She also commented that there were typos in the text you gave us but I told the wasn’t important here.  </p>
  <p>	The learning experiences this semester has been fun and fast paced.  I feel like I could spend a whole semester on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript each.  Learning the workflow of building a website structure with HTML, then adding the style with CSS, and finally adding some interactive elements with JavaScript was a wonderful experience.</p>
